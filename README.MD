# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of about 183000 ride information about individual rides made in
a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It includes the
duration, start and end time, gender, birth year, user type, location and other 
valuable information.


## Summary of Findings

1. The number of rides peak at 7 a.m in the morning and repeats at 5 p.m in the evening.
   This may possibly indicate that most users use the rideshare service to get to work in 
   the morning and to return home in the evening.
2. Users take longer rides on Weekends as compared to weekdays.

3. Customers take the longest rides for all genders and during any day compared tp subscribers.

4. The longest rides in the day are taken at 3 a.m. This is true for both customers and subscribers. 
   It is also concluded that, generally, customers take the longest rides at any hour of the day as compared to subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I display the influence of variables in question i.e user type, age , day of the week and gender on the ride duration. I start by introducing the duration variable and followed by the main variable â€” user type.

Afterwards, I introduce each of the relationship one by one. To start, I use the line plots of duration and day of the week to determine which days resulted in longer rides. Then, I do violin plots of duration and user type.  Age and gender, are covered afterwards, using bar plots.
